# LinkedIn Resume PDF Generator

A React/Typescript web app that takes a LinkedIn URL and spits out a
personalized PDF resume.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Node Version

Running `nvm use` will automatically switch you to the version of node being
used by this project. This value is saved in the `.nvmrc` file.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```javascript
npm i
```

Running the development server:

```javascript
npm run dev
```

Previewing a production build:

```javascript
// This will build and start the app on port 3000
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

This project uses
[`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to
automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
